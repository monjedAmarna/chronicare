# ✅ Refactor & Development Summary – ChronicareHealth

## 📁 1. Page Structure Refactoring

- Organized pages into role-based folders:
  - `src/pages/Admin/` → Dashboard, Reports, ManageUsers
  - `src/pages/Doctor/` → Dashboard, Patients, Alerts, CarePlans
  - `src/pages/Patient/` → HealthMetrics, Medications, CarePlans

## 🧹 2. Navigation Cleanup

- Removed duplicate `<Navigation />` components from all pages.
- Navigation is now rendered only once inside `App.tsx`.

## 🔁 3. Routing Updates

- Added proper routes in `App.tsx` for all pages based on roles:
  - `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/reports`
  - `/doctor/dashboard`, `/doctor/patients`, `/doctor/alerts`, `/doctor/care-plans`
  - `/patient/medications`, `/patient/health-metrics`, `/patient/care-plans`, etc.
- Updated `Navigation.tsx` to show different sidebar items based on user role.
