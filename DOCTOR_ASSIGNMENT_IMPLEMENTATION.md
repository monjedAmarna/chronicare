# Doctor Assignment Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented support for assigning a doctor during patient registration. Patients must now select their doctor from a dropdown list during registration, and the `doctorId` is stored in the `users` table.

## Backend Changes

### 1. API Endpoint: `GET /api/users/doctors`
- **File**: `backend/controllers/user.controller.js`
- **Function**: `getDoctors()`
- **Purpose**: Returns a list of all doctors (`id`, `name`, `email`) from the users table where `role = 'doctor'`
- **Access**: Public endpoint (no authentication required)

### 2. Updated Registration Logic
- **File**: `backend/controllers/auth.controller.js`
- **Function**: `registerUser()`
- **Changes**:
  - Accepts `doctorId` in request body
  - Validates that the doctor exists and has role `'doctor'`
  - Requires `doctorId` for patient registration
  - Stores `doctorId` in the new patient record
  - Returns `doctorId` in the response

### 3. Validation Updates
- **File**: `backend/validators/auth.validator.js`
- **Changes**: Added validation for `doctorId` as an integer

### 4. Route Updates
- **File**: `backend/routes/user.routes.js`
- **Changes**: Added public route for `/doctors` endpoint

## Frontend Changes

### 1. API Integration
- **File**: `client/src/api/user.api.ts`
- **Function**: `getDoctors()`
- **Purpose**: Fetches the list of doctors from the backend

### 2. Updated Registration Form
- **File**: `client/src/pages/Auth/Register.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added doctor selection dropdown (only shown for patients)
  - Fetches doctors list when role is "patient"
  - Validates that doctor selection is required for patients
  - Submits `doctorId` with registration data

### 3. Type Updates
- **File**: `client/src/api/auth.api.ts`
- **Changes**: Updated `RegisterData` and `UserProfile` interfaces to include `doctorId`

## Key Features

### ✅ Validation
- **Backend**: Validates that `doctorId` exists and belongs to a doctor
- **Frontend**: Requires doctor selection for patient registration
- **Database**: Stores the relationship in the `users` table

### ✅ User Experience
- Doctor dropdown only appears when "Patient" role is selected
- Shows doctor name and email for easy identification
- Loading state while fetching doctors
- Clear error messages for validation failures

### ✅ Security
- Doctor validation ensures only valid doctor IDs are accepted
- Role-based validation prevents invalid assignments
- Public endpoint for doctors list (needed during registration)

## Database Schema
The `users` table already has a `doctorId` field that stores the foreign key relationship:
```sql
doctorId: INTEGER (references users.id where role = 'doctor')
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start the backend and frontend servers
2. Navigate to the registration page
3. Select "Patient" as the account type
4. Verify the doctor dropdown appears
5. Select a doctor and complete registration
6. Verify the patient is created with the correct `doctorId`

### Automated Testing
Run the test script: `node test-doctor-assignment.js`
This will test:
- Fetching doctors list
- Patient registration with valid doctor
- Validation for missing doctorId
- Validation for invalid doctorId

## Sample API Responses

### GET /api/users/doctors
```json
[
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
    "email": "doctor@chronicare.com"
  }
]
```

### POST /api/auth/register (Patient)
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "role": "patient",
  "doctorId": 2
}
```

### Response
```json
{
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "user": {
    "id": 5,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "role": "patient",
    "doctorId": 2
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Doctor Selection
```
"Doctor selection is required for patient registration"
```

### Invalid Doctor ID
```
"Invalid doctor selected"
```

### Validation Errors
```
"Doctor ID must be a valid integer"
```

## Future Enhancements
- Allow patients to change their assigned doctor after registration
- Add doctor availability/specialty information to the dropdown
- Implement doctor-patient relationship management in admin panel
- Add notifications when patients are assigned to doctors
